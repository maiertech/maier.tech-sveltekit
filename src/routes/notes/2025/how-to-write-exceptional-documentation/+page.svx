Great article by Chris Nicholas on how to write exceptional documentation. He recommends the
following sections:

- Quickstart - Minimal steps to get started.
- Tutorials - Learning-focused guides that teach usage.
- How-to Guides - Problem-solving instructions.
- Explanations - Concepts and underlying theory.
- Examples/Templates - Working code samples and starter projects.

He dives into each section and provides many examples of documentation that nails these sections.
